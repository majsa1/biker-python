Python assignment using Tkinter and SQLite

Python assignment from HBO-ICT (Software Engineering), course Information Modeling & Database Design at THUAS (The Hague University of Applied Sciences).

Each student chooses an entity from a fictional bike rental company - customer, bicycle, accessory or employee - and creates a program with the following instructions:

- The program should make use of Python tkinter grid layout and notebook tabs
- Create a class with property methods for the chosen entity
- Import the class objects from a csv-file to a list
- Import the class objects from the list to a SQLite database
- A button press on the landing page fetches the objects and shows their attributes in the correct notebook tab
- Optional: Create tabs for the other 3 entities. 

Added extra functionality:
- text showing the date and time of the last fetch
- search functionality for employees and corresponding methods
- message boxes to show alerts
- error handling
